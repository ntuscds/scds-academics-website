# iLab @ NTU CCDS:  Innovation Lab @ NTU CCDS

## What is Innovation Lab @ NTU CCDS?

We are the student committee that serve the CCDS Innovation Lab, working to bridge the gap between learning and doing within the CCDS community. 

Our three main programmes include Catalyst@iLab, DevHub@iLab and the Student Entrepreneurship Programme (SEP).

Together, we aim to create a supportive, hands-on environment where students can grow as builders, mentors, and innovators.

## Catalyst@iLab

Catalyst@iLab is our mentorship programme, where we bring together the CCDS community by connecting seniors and juniors through small sharing sessions where seniors and alumni give pointers and tips and share about navigating through university and their career.

## DevHub@iLab

DevHub@iLab is our initiative focused on bridging the gap between theory and practice. We run weekly CodingPrep sessions to help students prepare for technical interviews, not just by solving LeetCode questions, but by practicing how to articulate their solutions out loud, a key skill for interview success.

Beyond interview prep, DevHub@iLab also organises hackathons and development programmes to upskill the CCDS community in software development. Our flagship programme is SummerBuild, a 5-week summer initiative featuring hands-on technical workshops, mentorship, and a final demo day where participants showcase the product they’ve built.

## Student Entrepreneurship Programme (SEP)

SEP is our funding initiative that supports student-led projects and startups with seed funding to explore, prototype, and build early-stage ideas. Whether you’re testing out a side project or taking the first step toward a startup, SEP is here to help turn your ideas into action.
