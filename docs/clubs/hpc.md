# NTUHPC: NTU High Performance Computing Club

![NTUHPC Club](/img/hpc/hpc-club.jpg)

**NTUHPC** is a student club dedicated to cultivating interest and excellence in **High Performance Computing (HPC)**. We provide students with the opportunity to delve into the exciting world of large-scale cluster computing systems and parallel programming, and connect with like-minded peers.

> **What is HPC?** High Performance Computing (HPC) is the art of using very large clusters of computers—think hundreds of CPUs, terabytes of RAM, and powerful GPUs—to run programs. These include AI/ML training, climate modeling, physics simulations, and more.

### Key Activities & Highlights

- **Workshops**: Learn parallel programming, cluster building, performance tuning, and more through hands-on workshops conducted by experienced seniors and industry experts.
- **Competitions**: We field NTU's official teams for international HPC competitions like:
  - [**SC Student Cluster Competition** (USA)](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/computing/news-events/news/detail/ntu-team-secures-the-highest-linpack-benchmark-award-at-sc24-in-atlanta-usa)
  - [**ISC Student Cluster Competition** (Germany)](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/computing/news-events/news/detail/team-ntu-celebrates-third-place-win-in-online-component-of-isc24-student-cluster-competition-at-hamburg-germany)
  - **APAC HPC-AI Competition**
