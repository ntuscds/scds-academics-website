# Interview Tips

Technical and behavioural interviews in the computing industry can be challenging and differ significantly from interviews in other fields. This guide provides strategies for various types of assessments you'll encounter in tech hiring processes. 

Do note that the number of interviews/online assestments may differ from company to company. Some companies might only have a behavioural interview round while others can span to 5 rounds (usually quant firms). However, by experience do expect companies to have at least one technical round and one behaviroral round for internship recruitment process. 

## Coding Interview Resources

Below are some recommended platforms, roadmaps, and handbooks to practice your coding interviews:
- **[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/)** - The most popular platform for coding interview preparation with 2000+ problems, company-specific question sets, and community discussions. Most tech companies use LeetCode-style questions in their interviews.
- **[Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)** - Offers a wide range of coding challenges and is commonly used by companies for their online assessments. Contains problems across various domains including algorithms, data structures, and specific languages.
- **[NeetCode Roadmap](https://neetcode.io/roadmap)** - A structured approach to LeetCode problems, organizing them by patterns and difficulty. Includes video explanations for the most common interview questions.
- **[Algomap.io Roadmap](https://algomap.io/)** - A visual way to learn algorithms, with interactive visualizations and explanations of common algorithms and data structures.
- **[Technical Interview Handbook](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/)** - Comprehensive guide with suggested study plans, common patterns, and tips for both technical and behavioral aspects of tech interviews.

## Behavioural Interview Resources

The NTU Career & Attachment Office (CAO) is dedicated to helping NTU students with their job search and career development. They offer valuable resources specifically designed for mastering behavioural interviews:

- **[Book a Mock Interview](https://tinyurl.com/zfbtmy53)** - Practice your interview skills in a realistic setting with professional career coaches who provide personalized feedback on your performance. These sessions are excellent for identifying areas of improvement before your actual interviews.
- **[Career Coaches](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/education/career-guidance-industry-collaborations/for-students/career-coaching---consultation/meet-your-career-coach)** - Connect with experienced career professionals who can guide you through interview preparation, resume crafting, and career planning. NTU's career coaches offer industry-specific advice tailored to computing students.

CAO also regularly conducts workshop sessions on behavioural interview techniques, including how to structure compelling STAR-method responses and present your experiences effectively to potential employers. Do look out for CAO sessions in your NTU email.

## Types of Assessments

### Online Assessments (OAs)

OAs typically consist of algorithmic coding problems with time limits. 

**Preparation Tips:**
- Practice on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and CodeSignal
- Familiarize yourself with common problem patterns.
- Time your practice sessions to build speed
- Learn to quickly identify the problem type (array, string, graph, etc.)
- Get comfortable with the platform's code editor before actual assessments

**During the OA:**
- Read all problems before starting and tackle the easiest ones first
- Use proper variable names and add comments for clarity
- Test your solution with different inputs before submitting
- If stuck, move on and return later if time permits
- Optimize only after you have a working solution

### Technical Interviews

These involve solving coding problems with an interviewer observing your process.

**Preparation Tips:**
- Practice coding while explaining your thought process out loud
- Master fundamentals: arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, dynamic programming
- Understand time and space complexity analysis
- Review computer science fundamentals

**During the Interview:**
- Clarify requirements and constraints before coding
- Discuss your approach before implementing
- Think out loud to demonstrate your problem-solving process
- Start with a brute force solution, then optimize
- Test your code manually, identifying edge cases
- Be receptive to hints from the interviewer

### Behavioral Interviews

These assess your soft skills, teamwork, and cultural fit.

**Preparation Tips:**
- Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to structure answers
- Prepare stories about team conflicts, challenges, and achievements
- Research the company's values and culture
- Review your resume and be ready to discuss any project in detail
- Prepare questions to ask the interviewer about the role and company

**During the Interview:**
- Be specific with examples, not generic statements
- Demonstrate self-awareness about strengths and areas for improvement
- Show how you've grown from past experiences
- Connect your experiences to the job requirements
- Be authentic rather than saying what you think they want to hear

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Not clarifying the problem**: Always ensure you understand the requirements
- **Jumping to code too quickly**: Think and plan before writing code
- **Staying silent**: Communicate your thought process continuously
- **Ignoring edge cases**: Consider boundary conditions and special inputs
- **Getting flustered when stuck**: It's okay to take a moment to think
- **Not testing your code**: Walk through your solution with examples

## Post-Interview Follow-up

- Send a thank-you email within 24 hours
- Reflect on your performance and note areas for improvement
- Don't be discouraged by rejections – use them as learning opportunities
- If rejected, you may politely ask for feedback from your recruiters
- Keep practicing and applying – technical interviewing is a skill that improves with practice
