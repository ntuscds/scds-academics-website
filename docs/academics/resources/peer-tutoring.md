# Student-Led Tutorial Group

## Overview

The school provides the necessary care & support for its students during their course of study in CCDS. Our students have an avenue to provide feedback on the various aspect pertaining to their studies. The school counselor can be reached easily here for the care & guidance that they may need in times of difficulties.

The program typically runs from Week 5 to Week 12 each semester and focuses on modules that have 5 or more registered tutees. Tutors/coaches earn $20 per hour for their teaching support.

The SCDS Club will notify students through email at the start of the semester when registration officially opens.
