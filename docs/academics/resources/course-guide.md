# Course Guide

This comprehensive guide will help you navigate your computing or data science curriculum, from understanding assessments to planning your course schedule effectively.

## Understanding Assessments

Different computing modules use various assessment methods:

- **Practical Assignments and Projects**: Most programming modules include individual or group projects.
- **Written Examinations**: Theory-heavy courses typically have mid-terms and final examinations.
- **Lab Tests**: Programming proficiency is often tested through timed coding exercises.
- **Quizzes and Class Participation**: Some modules include regular quizzes or grade participation.
- **Presentations**: Team projects often conclude with presentations of your work.

### Common Assessment Questions

<!-- #### Are there more projects and assignments or tests and examinations?

DSAI is a major combo of math and computer science mods. Most computer science mods are project based, while most math modules are examination based. So you will have an equal balance of project and exam based mods. -->

#### Are exam papers available for practice online?

Past year papers for most modules are uploaded in the [NTU library](https://ts.ntu.edu.sg/sites/lib-repository/exam-question-papers) website which you can access after you matriculate and get your Network Account.

#### How long is an examination?

It depends on the exam. Quizzes are around 30-90 mins, and examinations go from 1.5 to 3 hours depending on the course.

#### Will the exams from different modules be on the same day?

Yes some of the modules have exams on the same day so just plan your schedule accordingly.

#### Will exams take place at night?

The max timing an exam can have is till 7 pm not beyond that.

#### Will there be some kind of open book or cheat sheet during exams?

Some courses allow a restricted open book where you will be asked to bring ur cheat sheet which would comprise of one A4 sheet and some mods allow complete open book where you can bring all your lecture notes and the textbook and additional materials.

#### Do we use computers for exams?

For modules that require programming tests, usually these are done in lab tests before the finals exam period, on locked down school computers. Mostly the questions are given as a take-home assignment or such.

#### Will we be in groups for all projects or are there some individual projects/assignments?

There is a good mixture of individual assignments and group projects. Some projects will have individual components as well.

#### Are we graded on a bell curve?

Most projects do have bell curve or the grades will be standardised across cohort.

#### Do we get the same grades as our group members for projects?

Regarding having the same grades as ur group members, usually the Prof/TA(teaching assistant) will ask about the workload split of the project and that's how they will guage if everyone in the group gets the same marks.

#### What if I am unable to cope with my studies?

The professors do have consultation time slots which they will announce during the first lecture where you can go down to their office for any questions you may have. There are also peer tutoring sessions every week organised by the school. All the seniors are very helpful so do not be afraid to ask a senior for help!

#### Do I get to choose my own groupmates?

It depends on the module but generally you can choose your groupmates.

## Lecture and Tutorial Tips

- **Prepare Before Lectures**: Review materials before class to better understand the content.
- **Active Participation**: Engage in tutorials by attempting problem sets beforehand.
- **Form Study Groups**: Collaborating with peers can enhance your understanding.
- **Office Hours**: Take advantage of professors' and teaching assistants' office hours.
- **Online Resources**: Supplement your learning with online tutorials and documentation.

<!-- ## Scheduling Your Courses -->

<!-- ### Recommended Course Sequences

Below is a general recommended sequence for computing students:

**Year 1**
- Sem 1: CS1010, MA1101R, CS1231S
- Sem 2: CS2030, CS2040, MA1521

**Year 2**
- Sem 1: CS2100, CS2103T, CS2101, ST2334
- Sem 2: CS2105, CS2106, IS2101

**Year 3 & 4**
- Focus on specialization modules and level 4000 modules -->

<!-- ### Balancing Workload

- Consider the mix of programming-heavy and theory-heavy modules each semester
- Plan for project-based modules by checking deadlines in advance
- Balance computing modules with general education requirements -->

<!-- ## Electives and Specializations

Computing students can specialize in various areas:

- **Artificial Intelligence**: Focus on machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing
- **Computer Graphics and Games**: Study rendering, animation, and game development
- **Computer Security**: Explore cryptography, network security, and security policies
- **Database Systems**: Specialize in data management and analytics
- **Networking and Distributed Systems**: Study computer networks and distributed computing
- **Software Engineering**: Focus on software development methodologies and tools -->
