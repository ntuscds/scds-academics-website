# School Life

University life extends far beyond academics. This guide covers key aspects of student life at NTU, focusing on Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs), hall residence, and balancing academics with other commitments.

## Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs)

Getting involved in CCAs enriches your university experience by developing skills, building networks, and providing a break from academic work.

### Should I take a CCA?

Taking a CCA is encouraged if you want to make more friends from outside of your course and imperitive if you want to secure your place in your Hall of choice from Year 3 onwards (Hall is only guaranteed for the first 2 years in NTU). It is also recommended to have a leadership position as this increases the number of points that you have and thus your chances of getting a Hall.

### Types of CCAs

1. **Academic Clubs**
   - Computing clubs (like SCDS)
   - Subject-specific interest groups
   - Professional societies

2. **Cultural Activities**
   - Cultural performance groups
   - Arts and creative clubs
   - Music ensembles

3. **Sports**
   - Competitive sports teams
   - Recreational sports clubs
   - Fitness groups

4. **Community Service**
   - Volunteer groups
   - Social outreach programs
   - Environmental initiatives

### Benefits of Joining CCAs

- Develop soft skills like leadership, communication, and teamwork
- Build a network of friends and contacts outside your course
- Apply classroom knowledge in practical settings
- Enhance your resume with meaningful experiences
- Create a balanced university life

### Finding the Right CCA

- Attend student fairs at the beginning of each academic year
- Check the NTU Student Union website for a directory of clubs
- Join CCA tryouts and introductory sessions
- Consider your interests, time availability, and commitment level

## Hall Life

Living on campus provides a unique university experience with its own community and activities.

### Do you enjoy Hall life?

I think anyone that has stayed in Hall will tell you that it is the most fun time of your life. Of course this requires some effort on your part to make friends and attend events, join clubs and societies etc. Being a Hall Phantom (someone that just stays in Hall for the residence and doesn't participate) will not get you the experience that you deserve.

You do have to be prepared to spend quite some time with all of these activites as spending time socialising will come at the expense of your study time or your sleep (not recommended for health reasons but likely the first thing to be sacrificed). Thus, do take care to plan your time carefully and take care of your health at the same time.

Ultimately, your Uni life only comes once and it is the first time that most of us will venture out of the comforts of our own homes and live alone or with a roommate in a society of your peers. The friendships that you forge will last with you for a lifetime so do make the effort to make as many friends as possible and cherish the few that are the closest to you.

### Types of Accommodation

- **Halls of Residence**: Traditional halls with strong community focus and CCA involvement
- **Residential Colleges**: Theme-based living and learning communities with integrated curricula
- **Student Residences**: More independent living arrangements with fewer structured activities

### Hall Culture

- Each hall has its own distinct culture and traditions
- Most halls require CCA participation and maintain a points system
- Halls organize their own events, competitions, and orientation activities
- Inter-hall games foster friendly competition

### Tips for Hall Living

- Get involved in hall activities to make friends and build community
- Respect quiet hours and shared spaces
- Learn to manage your time between hall activities and academics
- Take advantage of proximity to academic facilities
- Consider hall seniority for room allocation in subsequent years

## Balancing Academics and Activities

One of the biggest challenges of university life is finding balance between academics and extracurricular activities.

### Time Management Strategies

- Use a planner or digital calendar to schedule all commitments
- Block out study time just as you would for classes and meetings
- Identify your most productive hours and use them strategically
- Learn to prioritize tasks based on importance and deadlines
- Build in buffer time for unexpected work

### Setting Boundaries

- Be realistic about how many commitments you can handle
- Learn to say no when necessary
- Communicate with CCA leaders about academic priorities
- Consider reducing commitments during exam periods

### Self-Care

- Schedule regular breaks and leisure activities
- Maintain healthy sleep, exercise, and eating habits
- Stay connected with friends and family
- Seek help from university counseling services if feeling overwhelmed

## Community Events and Networking

- Attend department seminars and talks by industry speakers
- Participate in hackathons, competitions, and workshops
- Join networking sessions and career fairs
- Connect with alumni through university events

Remember that your university experience is what you make of it. Balancing academics with a rich co-curricular life will help you develop holistically and make the most of your time at NTU.
