## Course Summary

SC2002 focuses on Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and design principles, including class and sequence diagrams. While some students found the content relevant and valuable for understanding OOP concepts, others struggled with the delivery, particularly citing difficulties with lecture clarity. One lecturer, Shen Zhiqi, was noted for having a challenging accent, making comprehension difficult, whereas the course materials, such as Li Fang’s extensive slides, were described as overwhelming due to their length.

## Workload

Opinions on workload vary significantly. Some found the workload relatively manageable, involving regular practice of OOP concepts and timely completion of labs. Conversely, others experienced a heavy workload, exacerbated by the need to repeatedly review lectures to understand the material. Team dynamics also impacted workload perception, with some students feeling burdened by teammates who contributed little.

## Projects

The course includes a mix of assessments: biweekly lab submissions, a midterm, a final exam, and a group project. The group project, however, received mixed feedback—some found it challenging and felt pressured to carry the team, while others criticized the assignment’s design, describing it as unrealistic or even generated by AI, such as creating a “Popeyes Ordering System.”

## Tips to Do Well

To succeed in SC2002, it is advisable to complete lab work promptly and consistently review course content to solidify understanding of OOP concepts. Given the high team dependency, securing reliable teammates is crucial; otherwise, be prepared to take on a larger share of the group project. Due to the variability in lecture clarity, students may need to invest extra time revisiting recorded lectures or supplementary materials. Some students even suggest prioritizing other modules if this course proves too challenging or unengaging.
