## Course Summary

MH2802 is a Linear Algebra course tailored for students in Physical and Computing Sciences. It is coordinated by Dr. Gu Mile, who is clear in his explanations and derives concepts from first principles. The course is math-heavy but focuses on real applications, like physical systems and Markov chains, to make the abstract ideas more relatable.

The topics taught include:

Vector Algebra & Analytical Geometry
Linear Spaces and Subspaces
Inner Products and Orthogonality
Linear Transformations and Matrix Representations
Matrix Algebra and Systems of Equations
Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Special Matrices (e.g., Hermitian, Unitary)
Applications to Physics and Computing (e.g., Coupled Oscillators, Markov Chains)

## Workload

The workload is moderate. There are weekly pre-lesson assessments that are auto-graded and help reinforce concepts. Lectures focus on derivations and problem-solving, while tutorials go through examples that may be tougher than the pre-lesson work. The midterm is relatively straightforward if you've kept up with tutorials. The final exam is theory-heavy and time-pressured, with a mix of conceptual and computational questions.

## Projects

There are no projects, but the course includes:

Pre-lesson assessments (12%) – auto-graded MCQs and short problems
Midterm test (28%) – covers vector algebra and linear spaces
Final exam (60%) – covers the entire syllabus with a mix of conceptual and problem-solving questions
Most of the learning comes from lectures, tutorials, and consistent practice.

## Tips to Do Well

Repeatedly do the practice paper and tutorials, but the level of difficulty of tutorials don't really match the finals' difficulty. Personally, I was lucky to get a TA that gave us extra practice questions for every topic, which was quite helpful. Unfortunately, Prof Mile Gu only provides 1 PYP for finals, and it was hard to find PYPs online, so if possible BEG seniors for them. Aim to attempt the bonus questions for both midterms and finals in hopes of getting a few extra marks. Prof Mile Gu is also a pretty approachable and chill professor, so don't hesitate to reach out to him.
