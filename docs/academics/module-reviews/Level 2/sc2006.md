## Course Summary

Shen Zhiqi is the best lecturer for this module. I don't understand a single thing he says starting from Week 2.

## Workload

Heavy, with a slacker in my group

## Projects

Epic, Barely doable

## Tips to Do Well

Start on the group project early. Expect sacrificing long hours of your weekend to do the project. If possible, learn some front-end languages before the project starts to save time. Try to communicate as much as possible with your groupmates as is it really hard to solo carry the project unless you are stacked at coding. Learn how to use GitHub for feature branching if you already haven't. Set clear goals and tasks to each members, and hold regular meetings to keep each other updated, so no work is overlapping.

The time allocated for the exam is relatively tight, so do spend it wisely. Some questions require you to apply the lecture contents to answer, in other words you can't find the answers directly on the lecture slides.
