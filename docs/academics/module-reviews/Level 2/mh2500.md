## Course Summary

The course gives you a basic introduction into Probability and Statistics, focusing more on the theory of statistics rather than the practicality. A lot of the content we have already learnt in Junior College, but perhaps more in depth and with more Calculus involved.

## Workload

The workload is quite reasonable but it is important to not fall behind!

## Projects



## Tips to Do Well

Watch Wu Guohua's lecture if you love mathematics and proving and you have to smart enough to follow his pace. Maybe lecture is not needed if you just want to pass this module. Just to tutorials
