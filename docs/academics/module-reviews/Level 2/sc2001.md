## Course Summary

This course teaches you about different algorithms and how to analyze time complexity for the first half of the course; the other half teaches you about dynamic programming, string matching, and others with various examples. Concepts are hard to understand, often requires additional effort by watching youtube videos.

## Workload

I would say the workload is quite heavy, there are 3 projects each requiring a presentation + one final exam.

## Projects

The 3 projects require you to implement algorithms and analyze their time complexity, which can be challenging, but you can refer to seniors' work on github for guidance. Final exam is very hard personally, some questions are not explicitly covered during lectures.

## Tips to Do Well

Do tutorials and understand the concepts very very very well.
