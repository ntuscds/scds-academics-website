## Course Summary

This course covers different algorithms and how to analyze their time complexity in the first half. The second half focuses on topics like dynamic programming, string matching, and others, with various examples. The concepts can be quite difficult to grasp, so you often need to put in extra effort by watching YouTube videos to fully understand them.

## Workload

The workload is fairly heavy. There are three projects, each requiring a presentation, plus one final exam.

## Projects

The three projects involve implementing algorithms and analyzing their time complexity, which can be challenging. However, you can refer to seniorsâ€™ work on GitHub for guidance. The final exam is personally very hard, with some questions not explicitly covered during lectures.

## Tips to Do Well

Make sure to do the tutorials and understand the concepts really, really well.
