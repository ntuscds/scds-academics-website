## Course Summary

First half of the course:
1. Entity Relationship (ER Diagrams)
2. Functional Dependencies
3. Normalization (BCNF, 3NF)

Second half of the course:
1. Relational Algebra
2. SQL
3. Semi-Structured Data

## Workload

Workload is reasonable for a 3AU module. 
Weekly:
2 x 1hr lectures
1 x 1hr tutorial
1 x 2 hr lab every 2 weeks

Content is reasonably easy to understand, and there are lots of online resources with information on the topics covered. Group project is also one of the more chill ones among the SC mods, especially since it involves a lot of team members.

## Projects

Group project with about 6 - 7 people that really tests your knowledge on lecture content, so in a way it is quite relevant, unlike some other group projects for coding modules. For me, the problem statement given was about investing portfolio, which can be quite confusing at times, but just clarify and google certain terms to better understand the relations. It consists of 5 labs, but only lab 1, 3 and 5 are graded, as lab 2 and 4 are just refinements of the previous labs.

## Tips to Do Well

Content may seem daunting at first, as there are many symbols, but I find writing everything out on a big whiteboard really deepens your understanding and appreciation for this module. For the SQL part, it just involves lots of practice. For the first midterm, the key is to finish the quiz and you will do better than average as the Prof basically makes it impossible to finish. Required to do 45 MCQ questions in 30 minutes, which is really a mad rush, especially since the first half of content really requires you to write down and process, but finishing it really puts you above the rest.
