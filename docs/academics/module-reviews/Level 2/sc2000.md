## Course Summary

SC2000 mainly covers statistical theories that should already be familiar from high school-level mathematics. It starts with concepts like random variables and probabilities, then moves on to statistical methods such as linear regression and hypothesis testing. Overall, the module is manageable and definitely passable. It consists solely of individual assessments, so your grade doesn’t depend on team members.

## Workload

The workload is very manageable. You’ll need to spend about 1–2 hours each week reviewing the lectures to really grasp the content.

## Projects

There are no assignments in this module.

## Tips to Do Well

- Review the lecture material regularly. Since some topics are interconnected, going over them weekly helps prevent confusion when starting new chapters.
- Don’t just stick to the tutorial questions. Search online for extra exercises on examinable topics. Tutorial questions tend to be simpler, while quizzes often feature more complex and time-consuming problems.
