## Course Summary

SC2000 mainly covers the statistical theories that should already be covered in High-School equivalent mathematics, starting from the concept of random variable, probabilities, statistical methods like linear regression and hypothesis testing. Generally, the module is do-able and ace-able. It only consists of individual assessment, not dependent on team members.

## Workload

Very manageable, need to spend around 1-2 hours weekly reviewing the lectures to really get a good grasp of the  content.

## Projects

No assignments.

## Tips to Do Well

- Regularly review the lecture material. Some of the materials are interconnected so try to review it every week so it does not leave any confusion when starting new chapter. 
- Try to learn beyond just the tutorial questions, look up on Google on exercises on the examinable topic, usually the tutorial questions present simpler questions, while the actual quiz usually presents more complicated and tedious questions.
