## Course Summary

Prof Yeo Kwee Poo mainly reads from slides and the textbook. His lectures tend to be quite dull, and I often find myself falling asleep within the first 15 minutes.

## Workload

The workload is extremely heavy, with over 600 slides to go through for this module. It’s hard to understand the lectures because he often mumbles when saying important points.

## Projects

There are finals, four assignments, and one midterm exam.

## Tips to Do Well

Focus on doing the tutorials well; you don’t really need to watch the lectures.
