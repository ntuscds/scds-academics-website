## Workload

If you follow the online answers for the labs, this module basically only has a final exam. The search topics are covered in SC1015, so theyâ€™re not new. Prof Yu Han emails tutorial answers to his tutorial groups.

## Projects

There are 2 take-home labs worth 40% of the grade, and a final exam worth 60%.

## Tips to Do Well

Lab answers are available online, so make use of them. Also, note that using Prolog for a lab feels quite outdated.
