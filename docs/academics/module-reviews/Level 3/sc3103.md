## Course Summary

This course on embedded programming is useful to learn more about linux, task scheduling, in depth regarding operating system and programming a stm32 and RPI board . It teaches you more indepth on computer networks as there is labs where you attempt client server connectivity like in computer networks. It provides a good background for students interested in linuc, os, mainly iot and robotics related fields. It is hard to get such learning opportunities and content and lab outside compared to software modules.

## Workload

This course has Lab on every alternate week, and all except 1/2 of these labs have a graded quiz at the end along with a graded lab. It is a doable workload and tutorials are well spread out with tutors going through qna, through explanations etc. Lectures are both recorded and in real life but both have good content depending on the kind of learner you are to decide on whether to attend lectures or not. 
labs are also doable and good support is provided.

## Projects

There is only Labs, lab quizzes , mid terms and finals for this module.

## Tips to Do Well

Attempt free access lab before the labs itself to prepare for graded lab and quiz, have a good understanding of operating systems SC2005, as it is very tied in and has professor Arvind in both modules.
