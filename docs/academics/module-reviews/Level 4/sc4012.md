## Course Summary

SC4012, software security, is simply Computer Security's software portion expanded into a full course. The course touches upon the definition of what we considers secure, some common "unforgivable exploits" and how to exploit them. It comes with a full CTF competition just for the module.

## Workload

There is one quiz at week 8 during tutorial time and a CTF competition around week 10 where you have one week to break into all the questions in a team. The competition should be complete-able within 1 day given a decent team. You will have to study the content of week 1-9 to stand a decent chance solving the CTF competition.

## Projects

20% is allocated to the CTF competition based on completion and a report is required to show that you understood the process to solve it. 20% is allocated to a week 8 quiz. The rest is allocated to a closed book finals.

## Tips to Do Well

Try out the CTF challenges recommended during class and get familiar with the debugger so you understand why your exploit failed.
