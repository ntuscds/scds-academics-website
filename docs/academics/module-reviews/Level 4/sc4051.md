## Course Summary

Teaches the fundamentals of distributed systems, such as basic characteristics, interprocess communication, distributed models etc. You won't learn much that's directly applicable in the real world, but I think it's still quite important to know as a CS student + may be useful in future technical interviews etc.

## Workload

Content is a bit heavy and dry but definitely manageable. Not math heavy; mostly concept-based.

## Projects

Just one course project implementing a simple client-server system (the domain problem changes every sem); shouldn't take more than 2 weeks even if you're doing it alone. Includes a demo so it must be working.

## Tips to Do Well

Keep up with the content and have some interest in lower level CS and you should be fine.
