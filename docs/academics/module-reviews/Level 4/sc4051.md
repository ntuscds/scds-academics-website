## Course Summary

This course covers the fundamentals of distributed systems, including basic characteristics, interprocess communication, distributed models, and more. While you might not learn much that’s directly applicable to real-world scenarios, I think it’s still important knowledge for any CS student and could come in handy for future technical interviews.

## Workload

The content can be a bit heavy and dry, but it’s definitely manageable. It’s not math-heavy and focuses mostly on concepts.

## Projects

There’s just one course project where you implement a simple client-server system (the specific problem changes each semester). It shouldn’t take more than two weeks, even if you’re working alone. The project includes a demo, so your system must be fully functional.

## Tips to Do Well

Keep up with the material and have some interest in lower-level CS concepts, and you should be fine.
