## Course Summary

The course offers an introduction to the variety of fundamental machine learning algorithms. The course focuses more on fundamental concepts and algorithms which proves to be useful for further studies in machine learning. The topics covered are:

Machine learning, its types and applications
Bayesian classifiers (e.g. naive Bayes, Bayesian belief networks)
Decision trees
Artificial neural networks
Support vector machines
Regression models
k-nearest neighbour classifiers
Ensemble learning
Clustering (e.g. k-means, hierarchical)
Density estimation
Dimensionality reduction

## Workload

The assessment is group project and final exam. The group project will be quite heavy as each member needs to constantly train models to improve your score in the kaggle competition. The final exam is quite manageable as long as you did past year practices.

## Projects

The group project is a Kaggle competition (from a choice of competitions which you may choose from) or a research project. The project is likely to cover topics outside of what the course teaches so may expect self-learning to some extent.

## Tips to Do Well

Start early for the project and attend lectures
