## Course Summary

Contains everything under the sun regarding Machine Learning all over again, along with quite some content of NNDL and a bit of content from Algorithm Design and Analysis, but applied in the context of Natural Language. Tough and content-heavy mod, will not recommend if you have not taken or not taking Machine Learning at the same time as a bare minimum if not you will not know what is going on at all especially during the second hal.

## Workload

Tough and content heavy mod, will not recommend if you have not taken or not taking Machine Learning at the same time as a bare minimum if not you will not know what is going on at all especially during the second half. 
Revision will include a lot of content and final exam questions are real killers, you will need to have a very strong understanding of the fundamentals of the concepts to be able to answer.
The second half is content heavy and the lecturer assumes you know many things about DL already, even though she is very good lecturer.

## Projects

1 Group Project, which consists of writing a comprehensive report on training multiple models on a NLP dataset. Start early, as DL models take centuries to train and fine tune.
2 Quizzes, one on the first half and one on the second half, challenging but not as bad as the final exam, no makeups, and weightage will be allocated to final exam if missed.

## Tips to Do Well

Start early on the group project, as DL models take centuries to train and fine tune.
Take this mod AFTER Machine Learning and AFTER/WITH NNDL of you'll get cooked unless you have prior knowledge in these subjects.
