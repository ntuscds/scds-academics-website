## Course Summary

SC1007 covers fundamental concepts of data structures and algorithms, focusing on abstract data types, algorithm efficiency, and problem-solving techniques. Major topics include linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, hash tables, and complexity analysis (Big O notation). The course emphasizes both theoretical understanding and practical application through coding assignments and labs.

## Workload

Moderate workload
Regular tutorials, but not all weeks
Midterm and assignments to test theoretical understanding and practical problem-solving skills
No final exam

## Projects

3 assignments on Hackerrank, covering all relevant data structures and algorithms. There is no team project for this module

## Tips to Do Well

Regularly attend labs and tutorials to practice coding.
Understand algorithm complexity thoroughly; practice analyzing algorithms using Big O notation.
Solve previous yearsâ€™ quizzes and exam questions for better exam preparation.
Ask for peer tutoring as there are many people good at this subject.
Practice such problems on coding platforms such as Codeforces, Leetcode or Hackerrank
