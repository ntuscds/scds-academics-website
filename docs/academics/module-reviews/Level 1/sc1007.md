## Course Summary

SC1007 covers the fundamental concepts of data structures and algorithms, focusing on abstract data types, algorithm efficiency, and problem-solving techniques. Major topics include linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, hash tables, and complexity analysis using Big O notation. The course balances theoretical understanding with practical application through coding assignments and labs.

## Workload

The workload is moderate, with regular tutorials held most weeks. Assessment includes a midterm and assignments designed to test both theoretical knowledge and practical problem-solving skills. There is no final exam.

## Projects

There are three individual assignments on Hackerrank, each covering relevant data structures and algorithms. This module does not include any team projects.

## Tips to Do Well

Attend labs and tutorials regularly to get hands-on coding practice. Make sure you thoroughly understand algorithm complexity and practice analyzing algorithms using Big O notation. Work through previous years’ quizzes and exam questions to prepare effectively. Don’t hesitate to seek peer tutoring, as many students excel in this subject. Additionally, practice similar problems on coding platforms like Codeforces, Leetcode, or Hackerrank.
