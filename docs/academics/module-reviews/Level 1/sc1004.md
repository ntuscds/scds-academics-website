## Course Summary

SC1004 focuses on Linear Algebra, covering a range of fundamental topics. Assessment consists of two tests, each contributing 25% to the final grade, with non-overlapping content, and a final paper worth 50%. The course demands a solid grasp of concepts and consistent study throughout the semester.

## Workload

The workload is quite heavy and content-dense, requiring steady effort and regular practice. Students without a prior background in linear algebra may find the material especially challenging and may need to dedicate significant time to tutorials and self-study to keep up.

## Projects

Assessment primarily involves individual work, including two quizzes. There is minimal to no team dependency in this course.

## Tips to Do Well

To succeed, it is crucial to stay consistent and actively engage with the material. Watching review lectures can greatly aid understanding, and supplementing study with external resources like YouTube videos is highly recommended. Given the difficulty, grinding through tutorials and practice problems is essential.
