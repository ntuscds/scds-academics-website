## Course Summary

This course covers the basic mathematics that will be used and applied throughout the four years of study. Past lectures were made available, and during the live sessions, the professor repeated the same questions, answers, and jokes. However, you do get chances to ask questions after the lectures.

## Workload

The workload is light, but you need to keep up to date and cannot postpone everything until later in the semester.

## Projects

There are weekly topic-based online quizzes that help you stay current with the course material. The take-home test problem set is determined by the last character of your matriculation number. There are also midterms and final exams, both of which are manageable if you can complete the PYPs (past year papers).

## Tips to Do Well

Many students have prior experience with several topics, especially those who took H2 Math in JC. If youâ€™re not comfortable with some topics, make sure to work through the PYPs thoroughly.
