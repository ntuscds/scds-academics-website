## Course Summary

MH1812 covers fundamental discrete mathematics topics such as sets, logic, induction, modular arithmetic, counting, functions, graph theory, and proof techniques. The module aims to develop abstract thinking and problem-solving skills, teaching students how to construct and understand mathematical proofs. While the concepts may initially challenge your thinking process, with practice, many elegant solutions emerge. The course is structured around midterms and a final exam, emphasizing understanding over continuous assessment.

## Workload

The workload is generally considered fair and manageable for a first-year computing module. Although it is a 3 AU course, the absence of assignments or projects means the workload mainly involves preparing for two midterms and a final exam. Some students find the material challenging, especially the proof and counting sections, which may require consistent effort throughout the semester rather than last-minute cramming.

## Projects

There are no projects or continuous assignments in this module. Assessment consists solely of two midterm tests, each contributing 25% to the final grade, and a final exam worth 50%. This structure places significant emphasis on exam preparation.

## Tips to Do Well

To excel in MH1812, it is crucial to attend tutorials and actively engage with practice problems. Consistently working through past year papers is highly recommended, as exam questions tend to be very similar across years. Additionally, reviewing proofs carefully to understand their logic and practicing manipulating them to fit different questions will deepen comprehension. Supplementing study with external problem sets, especially for counting problems, can also be beneficial. Starting early and avoiding last-minute rushes will help manage the workload effectively.
