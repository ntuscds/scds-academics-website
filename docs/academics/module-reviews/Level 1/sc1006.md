## Course Summary

Assembly language programming and computer architecture. First half focusses on how the ARM processor works and how to write assembly code for ARM. Second half is about computer systems and understanding the benefits and drawbacks of different components.

## Workload

A lot of memorising needed, tutorials are quite sufficient in cementing knowledge to prepare for lab tests

## Projects

One midterm and one Final, 4 lab tests

## Tips to Do Well

Attend the lecture for the first half. It is the key to excellence. Prof Aly is just awesome! He gives very clear explanations about everything and give a lot of practise questions from basic to more advanced. The structure of the questions and the type of questions he asks during the lecture is not only very similar to those in the midterm quiz, but also help you understand the concept really well.
