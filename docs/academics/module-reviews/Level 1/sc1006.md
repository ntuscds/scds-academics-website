## Workload

Workload is not that high but the midterm is where everyone suffer. It is hard if you do not understand the structure and the link from the start. 

## Projects

No projects. You just need to do the lab beforehand, or pay extra attention to the lab sessions in order to do the lab quizzes well.

## Tips to Do Well

Attend the lecture for the first half. It is the key to excellence. Prof Aly is just awesome! He gives very clear explanations about everything and give a lot of practise questions from basic to more advanced. The structure of the questions and the type of questions he asks during the lecture is not only very similar to those in the midterm quiz, but also help you understand the concept really well.
