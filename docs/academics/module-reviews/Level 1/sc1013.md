## Course Summary

This course introduces fundamental physics concepts — including optics, electricity, electronics, and magnetism — and contextualizes their relevance in computing systems. The lectures are conceptually driven and supplemented with practical examples and tutorial problems.

## Workload

I took this module quite a while back so I might be wrong, but weekly lectures cover foundational physics topics while tutorials focus on applying concepts through real-world problem-solving. It is somewhat similar to O-level physics. Time commitment is probably around 4–6 hours/week (including lectures, tutorials, and assignments)

## Projects

For this module, just be consistent in doing tutorials and keeping up with lectures. There are no projects nor tutorial sessions. It is a pass-fail module.

## Tips to Do Well

The key is to make sure you understand important formulae, and do practice questions. As long as you know how to apply the formulae in solving the questions, you're good to go!
