## Course Summary

This course introduces fundamental physics concepts—including optics, electricity, electronics, and magnetism—and explains their relevance to computing systems. The lectures focus on conceptual understanding and are supported by practical examples and tutorial problems.

## Workload

I took this module a while ago, so I might be a bit off, but the weekly lectures cover foundational physics topics, while tutorials focus on applying these concepts through real-world problem-solving. It’s somewhat similar to O-level physics. The time commitment is probably around 4–6 hours per week, including lectures, tutorials, and assignments.

## Projects

For this module, consistency is key—keep up with the lectures and complete the tutorials regularly. There are no projects or separate tutorial sessions. The module is graded on a pass-fail basis.

## Tips to Do Well

Make sure you understand the important formulae and practice applying them to solve questions. As long as you can use the formulae effectively, you should be fine!
