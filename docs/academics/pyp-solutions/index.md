We're excited to introduce **PYPHub**, our upcoming forum dedicated to past year paper solutions. 

- Allowing students to discuss PYP questions and vote on the best answers
- Making solutions more reliable through community validation
- Incorporating an AI feature to generate initial solutions, which students can then discuss and improve upon
- Ensuring the most recent exam formats and question styles are tracked and updated
